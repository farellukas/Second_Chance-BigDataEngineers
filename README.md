# Second Chance by BigDataEngineers

## Inspiration
We decided to build the Second Chance app to allow individuals to better transition to the country they seek refugee in with ease. Especially nowadays when the refugee crisis is worsening as time goes by, it is important that those who seek refuge receives the best support they could possibly get. 

## What it does
The app acts as an all-in-one platform that contains tools such as unit converters, language translators, a news feed, and a public support chatroom that will be very useful for refugees to use when they first arrive to their new country.
 
## How we built it
We created the application using the MERN stack, where we used React along with Material UI to create the frontend and used a combination of Express and MongoDB, in combination with several APIs, running on a Node.js runtime for the backend.

## Challenges we ran in
It was difficult for us to look for effect API solutions to use for our application due to the limited budget we have and that most APIs, specifically the news API, are usually paid services. Other than that, a few of our team members have just started learning web development and faced through multiple technical obstacles when trying to create using React.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We managed to implement multiple functions that we wanted in the limited time that we had.

## What we learned
We learned how important conventions are, and how prior planning and organization makes a huge difference in how efficiently we can get work done. 

## What's next for Second_Chance (BigDataEngineers)
We hope to add more features to the app to better improve the quality of life of refugees, one of the things being that we would like to implement an AI model that can filter out malicious comments in the public chatroom to create a safer environment, especially for refugees.
